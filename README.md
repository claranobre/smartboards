# smartboards

Smartboards is an interactive networked public noticeboard framework. It was developed to facilitate remote communication between the [Cambridge Computer Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/)'s [Graphics and Interaction](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/) research group.

smartboards was designed for large touch-screen displays that line the research group's corridor, each powered by a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

It has three web-app interfaces:
1. The `kiosk` - an optimized editor designed for public terminal use
2. The `editor` - a feature-rich editor designed for desktop or mobile use
3. The `viewer` - a way to quickly view people's smartboards on desktop or mobile
